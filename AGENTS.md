# AGENTS Guide

**EVERY AI AGENT MUST FOLLOW THIS GUIDE BEFORE ANY WORK.**

## Required startup sequence

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` before running commands, analyzing code, or editing files.
2. Follow the role boundaries and rules in `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Read only task-relevant files under `.ai-instructions/`.

## Additional rules

- If `CLAUDE.md` changes, read it again before continuing.
- If user instructions conflict with repository conventions, prioritize user intent for that task.
- Higher-priority system/developer/user instructions override this guide.
