# Codex Rules

Before doing any work in this repository, read `CLAUDE.md` first.

## Required startup sequence

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` completely before running commands, analyzing code, or editing files.
2. Follow role boundaries and rules from `CLAUDE.md`.
3. Read only the relevant files under `.ai-instructions/` for the current task.

## Additional rules

- If `CLAUDE.md` changes, re-read it before continuing.
- If user instructions conflict with repository conventions, follow user intent for that task.
- Higher-priority system/developer/user instructions override this file.
