# Address PR Comments Workflow

Intelligently triage PR review comments, address actionable feedback, and resolve informational comments.

## Input

Accept PR number (`123`, `#123`) or branch name (`feature-branch`).

## Workflow

1. Match input to PR
2. Fetch unresolved comments
3. Classify comments
4. Get user confirmation on ALL comments
5. Address user-selected comments with code changes
6. Reply and resolve threads

## Step 1: Match Input to PR

```bash
# PR number
gh pr view <number> --json number,title,headRefName,state

# Branch name
git branch --show-current
gh pr list --head <branch> --json number,title,state
```

## Step 2: Fetch Unresolved Comments

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "ChaoWao", name: "simpler") {
    pullRequest(number: <number>) {
      reviewThreads(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          id isResolved
          comments(first: 1) {
            nodes { id databaseId body path line }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

Filter to `isResolved: false` only.

## Step 3: Classify Comments

| Category | Description | Examples |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| **A: Actionable** | Code changes required | Bugs, missing validation, race conditions, incorrect logic |
| **B: Discussable** | May skip if follows `.claude/rules/` | Style preferences, premature optimizations |
| **C: Informational** | Resolve without changes | Acknowledgments, "optional" suggestions |

Present summary showing category, file:line, and issue for each comment. For Category B, explain why code may already comply with `.claude/rules/`.

## Step 4: Get User Confirmation

**Always let the user decide which comments to address and which to skip.** Present ALL unresolved comments (A, B, and C) in a numbered list with their classification and brief summary.

Ask the user to specify which comments to address, skip, or discuss:

- Recommend addressing Category A items
- Mark Category B with rationale for skipping or addressing
- Mark Category C as skippable by default

**User choices per comment:** Address (make changes) / Skip (resolve as-is) / Discuss (need clarification)

Only proceed with the comments the user explicitly selects. Do NOT auto-resolve any comment without user consent.

## Step 5: Address Comments

For user-selected comments only:

1. Read files with Read tool
2. Make changes with Edit tool
3. Commit using `/git-commit` skill

## Step 6: Resolve Comments

Reply using:

```bash
gh api repos/ChaoWao/simpler/pulls/<number>/comments/<comment_id>/replies -f body="..."
```

Then resolve thread with GraphQL `resolveReviewThread` mutation.

**Response templates:**

- Fixed: "Fixed in `<commit>` — description"
- Skip: "Current code follows `.claude/rules/<file>`"
- Acknowledged: "Acknowledged, thank you!"

## Best Practices

| Area | Guidelines |
| ---- | ---------- |
| **Analysis** | Reference `.claude/rules/`; when unsure → Category B |
| **Changes** | Read full context; minimal edits; follow project conventions |
| **Communication** | Be respectful; explain reasoning; reference rules |

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
| ----- | ------ |
| PR not found | `gh pr list`; ask user to confirm |
| Not authenticated | "Run: `gh auth login`" |
| Unclear comment | Mark Category B for discussion |

## Checklist

- [ ] PR matched and validated
- [ ] Unresolved comments fetched and classified
- [ ] ALL comments presented to user for selection
- [ ] Code changes made and committed (use `/git-commit`)
- [ ] Changes pushed to `origin`
- [ ] All comments replied to and resolved

## Remember

**Not all comments require code changes.** Evaluate against `.claude/rules/` first. When in doubt, consult user.
